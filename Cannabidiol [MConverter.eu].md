**Market Segmentation Overview**

The cannabidiol market is categorized based on several core segments
that include source, sales type, end use, and sales channel. Each
category contributes uniquely to the evolving landscape of CBD products
and services.

**1. By Source Type**

The origin of cannabidiol plays a crucial role in determining its
chemical profile, legality, and end-use applicability. The two primary
sources are:

**Hemp-Derived CBD**

Hemp is low in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and high in CBD content,
making it legally accessible in several countries. Hemp-derived CBD is
widely used in dietary supplements, cosmetics, pet products, and
wellness applications due to its non-intoxicating nature and favorable
regulatory status in many regions.

**Marijuana-Derived CBD**

Marijuana-derived CBD typically contains higher levels of THC and is
more tightly regulated. However, it is preferred for medical use in some
jurisdictions due to its strong therapeutic properties. Its availability
is largely dependent on local and national drug laws.
